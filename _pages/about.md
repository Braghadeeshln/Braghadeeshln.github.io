Here is the restructured version with corrected grammar while keeping the parentheses for URLs unchanged:

I am Braghadeesh Lakshminarayanan, a doctoral student in the Division of Decision and Control Systems (DCS) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. I began my doctoral studies in August 2021 under the supervision of [Prof. Cristian Rojas](https://people.kth.se/~crro/). 

I graduated with a Master's degree (M.Tech) in Communication and Networks (CN) in July 2020 from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, India, where I was advised by [Prof. Aditya Gopalan](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~aditya/index.html). Prior to joining IISc, I worked as a VLSI Engineer at Wipro Technologies, Bangalore, India, from 2016 to 2017. I earned my Bachelor's degree (B.Tech) in Electronics and Communication Engineering in 2016 from the National Institute of Technology, Trichy, India.

My research interests include parameter estimation, control theory, optimization, and sequential decision-making under uncertainty.
